            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The CASE of Henry Long Eſq;</head>
            <p>
               <hi>JOHN Long,</hi> late of Little <hi>Chiverell,</hi> in the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> Eſq; being ſeized in fee ſimple of divers Meſſuages, Lands, and Tenements lying in <hi>Melkſham</hi> in the ſaid County, and having no Wife, Child, Brother, or Siſter then living; but having divers Nephews, and being deſirous to Settle his ſaid Lands and Premiſes in the Male Line of his Family according to their Heirſhip, by his laſt Will and Teſtament in Writing; bearing Date <hi>July</hi> the Twentieth 1676. did deviſe all his Eſtate in <hi>Melkſham</hi> aforeſaid (except two little Tenements thereby given to <hi>John Philipps)</hi> unto his Nephew <hi>Henry Long,</hi> who was eldeſt Son of <hi>Richard Long</hi> the Teſtators eldeſt Brother, for and during the Natural Life of him the ſaid <hi>Henry Long,</hi> who was his Heir at Law, and from and after his Deceaſe, to the firſt Son of the Body of the ſaid <hi>Henry Long</hi> lawfully Begotten, and the Heirs Males of the Body of ſuch firſt Son law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Iſſuing; and for default of ſuch Iſſue, to the 2d. 3d. 4th. 5th. 6th. 7th. and every other Son of the Body of the ſaid <hi>Henry Long,</hi> lawfully to be Begotten ſucceſſively and reſpectively as they ſhould be in Priority of Birth and Seniority of Age, and to the Heirs Males of their Bodies ſucceſſively and reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively Iſſuing the Elder of ſuch Sons, and the Heirs Males of his Body Iſſuing, being always prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the younger, and the Heirs Males of his Body Iſſuing: And for default of ſuch Iſſue,</p>
            <p>To <hi>Richard Long</hi> ſecond Son of the Teſtators Brother <hi>Richard</hi> for his Life, and from and after his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe to his 1ſt. 2d. 3d. 4th. 5th. 6th. 7th. and every other Son in the ſame manner as above. And for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of ſuch Iſſue, then</p>
            <p>To no leſs then nine ſeveral other Nephews of the Teſtator, particularly named in the ſaid Will, in the ſame manner; and eſpecial care is taken by the Teſtator, that they ſhould all take according to their Heirſhip.</p>
            <p>Upon the Teſtators Death, which was ſoon after this Will was made, <hi>Henry</hi> entred upon this Eſtate, and inter-marryed with <hi>Ann Long,</hi> Daughter of <hi>John Long,</hi> late of <hi>South Wraxall</hi> in <hi>Wilts,</hi> Eſq; by whom he had Iſſue one Daughter; and about <hi>Lady-day,</hi> 1687. <hi>Henry</hi> dyed, leaving his ſaid Wife enſeint with a Son who was born within Seven Months after his Fathers Death, and Baptized by the Name of <hi>Henry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the death of <hi>Henry</hi> without any Son, <hi>Richard Long</hi> being the next in Remainder, entred and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed theſe Lands, but on the Birth of <hi>Henry</hi> the now <hi>poſt humus</hi> Infant; <hi>Richard</hi> well knowing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his Unckle the Teſtators Will, laid no further claim to the Premiſes, but ſuffered <hi>Ann</hi> the Widow of <hi>Henry,</hi> and Mother of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>poſt humus</hi> Infant, to enjoy this Eſtate as Guardian to her ſaid Son, who hath enjoyed it ſo ever ſince the Birth of her Son without any Interruption, till now lately <hi>Richard</hi> hath commenced an Action of Ejectment for this Eſtate, on which Action there is a ſpecial Verdict found, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all this matter.</p>
            <p>It was and muſt be agreed, That if this Child had been born in the life time of his Father, the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle had been in him; but only for the reaſon he was not Born till after his Fathers Death, Judgment is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the ſaid <hi>Richard Long.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas the Intent of the Teſtator is the main and only thing conſiderable in a Will, and the intent in this Caſe is Notorious; That the Son of <hi>Henry</hi> whether born before or after his Fathers Death, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy this Eſtate, as appears by the great care taken to limit it to ſo many Nephews, according to Heirſhip.</p>
            <p>And whereas a <hi>poſt humus</hi> Son is as much an Heir as one born in the life of his Anceſtor; and conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Wills ought to be in favour of an Heir at Law, and the Teſtators meaning; in regard Men in extreams are not ſuppoſed to have Counſel for their aſſiſtance. And whereas this Will was made in the Teſtators laſt Sickneſs, and for the Benefit of his Heir, 'twill be hard to fruſtrate the intent of his Will, and wreſt his meaning to diſinherit his Heir; when by the Laws of all Nations, a Will is nothing but a Declaration of the Parties Mind, how, and by whom his Eſtate ſhall be enjoyed, and this is as plain here as words can make it.</p>
            <p>The Conſequence of ſuch a Judgment, will be to give <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> a power not only to expound but to make Mens Wills, and to diſpoſe of their Eſtates contrary both to their words and meaning, ſince both are manifeſtly plain in this laſt, in favour of the ſaid <hi>Henry Long</hi> the Infant.</p>
